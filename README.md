# Age Estimator

Estimate the age based on human facial images. To perform the task, we use 3 different machine learning models:

- Regression
- Clustering
- CNN


*(NOTE: this project is under development!)*

## Data

Datasets used for this project are large enough (> 100,000 samples and > 100 features, i.e., > 10M non-zeros) to train the model.
